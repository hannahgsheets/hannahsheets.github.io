    <div id="box1"><p><big>I want to enroll in the applied concentration program because of the many amazing classes and opportunities that this major offers. This program will allow me to be more equipped for the industry as it will teach me how to use standard programs and fundamental design skills that employers look for in hiring pools. Not only that, but it will encourage me to stand out against other applicants with the internship experiences the Emerging Technology and Business Design program offers. If I am accepted I will be able to expand my knowledge in my interest in digital design, which ranges from user experience to graphic design. The wide range of benefits the Emerging Technology and Business Design studies offers, including classes and opportunities, is the reason why I want to be admitted into the program.

    <div id="box2"></div><p><big>Ever since I was young, I have always been interested in the combination of technology and art. At the end of elementary school, I got my first IPad for Christmas. My favorite hobby was drawing, so I painfully drew with my index finger for hours on end before saving up for any formal software, creating pieces of digital art. Soon, I delved deeper into programs to play with projects such as animation, 3D modeling, and video editing, pushing the boundaries of what I could create. I have always been drawn towards digital art as it contains limitless possibilities in medium, allowing users to connect with an audience in ways traditional approaches would not be able to convey. That is the magic of the user experience from the creative end; figuring out how to connect to an audience through a product.</big></p></div>
